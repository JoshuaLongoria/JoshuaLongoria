Iâ€™m a recent graduate passionate about technology, cybersecurity, and solving complex problems. I enjoy building projects that strengthen my skills in security analysis, network defense, and automation while continuously learning and sharing knowledge with the community.

## Objective

My background in computer science and hands-on projects has fueled a strong passion for cybersecurity. I am eager to begin my career in the field by joining a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst, where I can apply my skills in threat detection, incident response, and continuous learning to protect and strengthen organizational security.
